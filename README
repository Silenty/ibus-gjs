ibus-gjs
It is a GNOME-Shell GJS Plugin for IBus
The ibus-gjs works with ibus on gnome-shell.
So you need to install gnome-shell and ibus and enable 3D accelerator with
your graphics card to launch gnome-shell.


Build and install from source
=============================

The build make & make install expect to install the files into system
directories since we'd try to integrate this module into upstream gnome-shell.
 - js files are installed in 
   /usr/share/gnome-shell/js/ui/status/ibus
 - extension files are installed in
   /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ibus-indicator@example.com

Need to enable the ibus extension by manual after you install ibus-gjs:

Run gnome-tweak-tool on gnome-shell and enable the extension of
"Input-Method Status Indicator"

or

Set a gsetting value by manual:
% gsettings get org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions
[]
% gsettings set org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions "['ibus-indicator@example.com']"
% gsettings get org.gnome.shell enabled-extensions
['ibus-indicator@example.com']



Download and install from web site
==================================

You can install ibus-gjs with the user privilege.
You need to uninstall the ibus-gjs if you installed it.
1. Run gnome-shell
2. Enable "Input-Method Status Indicator" below
https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/68/input-method-status-indicator/

The community version disables an ibus xkb feature because the Fedora
specific feature is not upstreamed in ibus yet.
You could see that user.patch disables XKB in ibusPanel.js and xkbLayout.js.
So if you would use this on Fedora, you could enable XKB to modify
ibusPanel.js and xkbLayout.js by manual.

Actually the web site dowloads the ibjs-gjs files under the user directory
and enables the gnome.shell gsettings above.

% cd $HOME
% mkdir -p .local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ibus-indicator@example.com
% cp /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ibus-indicator@example.com/* \
  .local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ibus-indicator@example.com/.
% mkdir .local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ibus-indicator@example.com/ibus
% cp /usr/share/gnome-shell/js/ui/status/ibus/* \
  .local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ibus-indicator@example.com/ibus/.
% cd .local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ibus-indicator@example.com
% patch -p1 < user.patch

(To upload the files in extensions.gnome.org,
bump the version in metadata.json and
% cd ibus-indicator@example.com
% zip -r ibus-indicator@example.com.zip \
  extension.js ibus metadata.json stylesheet.css
)


Installation failure
====================

The gnome-shell extension module has the version information of gnome-shell
and gjs, and gnome-shell checks the versions.
If the versions are not matched, the gnome-shell ibus extension is not enabled.
You could check if the versions are matched by manual.

% rpm -q gnome-shell
gnome-shell-3.2.1-1.fc16.x86_64
% rpm -q gjs
gjs-1.30.0-1.fc16.x86_64
% egrep 'shell-version|js-version' \
  /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ibus-indicator@example.com/metadata.json
{"shell-version": ["3.2"],
 "js-version": ["1.30"],
